This is an open source project 

(College Social System) - The aim is to transition from hardcopies to softcopies and live on the internet.

Student timetable is uploaded and reflected in student's view
inter campus social network (Can decide to link with students from other schools)
Inventory (eBooks, Pdfs, tutorials, Syllabus, whatever could be useful )
integrate lecturer view
Money Management (Allowance per wk/month against total expenses at the end of the month)
Lecturer should be able to assign/accept assignments
There should be announcement privileges
Fee Payment status of student.
Registration status.
Geolocation available (Friends can request location upon authorization) - aids in minimizing rate of stealing
course rep should be able to share timetable

LECTURER VIEW
All students info for that course are available for attendance taking and saved into database
biometric scanner mandatory for every lecturer to clock in student. (can be bypassed)
Test result, CA and eventually exam results for each student is easily uploaded and solely available to the individual assigned the result


Student can predict GPA with data provided by the lecturer( When school releases the actual result, student can challenge the result if they dont match or not within a reasonable range) - this eliminates foul play and also helps with retention of vital information that may be lost before results are collated.
